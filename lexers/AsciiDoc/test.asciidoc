This is a demonstration of {library}. And this is the preamble of this document.

[[purpose]]
.Purpose
****
This document exercises many of the features of AsciiDoc to test the Asciidoctor implementation.
****

TIP: If you want the output to look familiar, copy (or link) the AsciiDoc stylesheet, asciidoc.css, to the output directory.

NOTE: Items marked with TODO are either not yet supported or work in progress.

[[first]]
== First steps

.Inline markup
* single quotes around a phrase place 'emphasis'
* astericks around a phrase make the text *bold*
* double astericks around one or more **l**etters in a word make those letters bold
* double underscore around a __sub__string in a word emphasize that substring.

// separate two adjacent lists using a line comment (only the leading // is required)

- escape characters are supported
* for instance, you can escape a quote inside emphasized text like 'Here\'s Johnny!'
- you can safely use reserved XML characters like <, > and &, which are escaped when rendering
- force a space{sp}between inline elements using the \{sp\} attribute
- hold text together with an intrinsic non-breaking{nbsp}space attribute, \{nbsp\}
- handle words with unicode characters like in the name Gregory RomÃ©.

You can write text http://example.com[with inline links], optionally{sp}using an explicit link:http://example.com[link prefix]. In either case, the link can have a http://example.com?foo=bar&lang=en[query string].

If you want to break a line +
just end it in a {plus} sign +
and continue typing on the next line.

.Adjacent lists
* this list
* should join

* to have
* four items

.Numbered lists (TODO)
. These items
. will be auto-numbered
.. and can be nested
. A numbered list can nest
* unordered
* list
* items

.Statement
I swear I left it in 'Guy\'s' car. Let\'s go look for it.

[[defs]]
term::
  definition
[[another_term]]another term::

  another definition, which can be literal (indented) or regular paragraph

This should be a standalone paragraph, not grabbed by the definition list.

[[nested]]
* first level
written on two lines
* first level
+
....
with this literal text
....
+
** second level
*** third level
- fourth level (TODO)
* back to +
first level

// this is just a comment

Let's make a horizontal rule...

'''

then take a break.

We'll be right with you...

after this brief interruption.

== We're back!

Want to see a image:images/tiger.png[Tiger]? (TODO)

Do you feel more safe with the tiger in a box?

.Tiger in a box
image::images/tiger.png[]

include::include.asciidoc[]

.Asciidoctor usage example, should contain 3 lines (TODO)
[source, ruby]
----
doc = Asciidoctor::Document.new("*This* is it!", :header_footer => false)

puts doc.render
----

Here's what it outputs (using the built-in templates):

....
<div class='paragraph'>
  <p><strong>This</strong> is it!</p>
</div>
....

=== Quotes

____
AsciiDoc is so powerful!
____

This verse comes to mind.

[verse]
La la la

Here's another quote:

[quote, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]
____
When you have eliminated all which is impossible, then whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.
____

== Getting Literal

 Want to get literal? Just prefix a line with a space (just one will do).

....
I'll join that party, too.
....

. first rule (yeah!)
. second rule, looking `so mono`

// This attribute line will get reattached to the next block
// despite being followed by a trailing blank line
[id='wrapup']

== Wrap-up

NOTE: AsciiDoc is quite cool, you should try it!

// A fix for these last two admonitions is in progress.
