///   Multiplexer that serializes inputs from multiple producers into a single 
///   consumer enumeration in a user-specified order. 
/// </summary>
/// <typeparam name="T">The type of input element</typeparam>
/// <remarks>
///   The use case for this class is a producer/consumer scenario with multiple producers and 
///   a single consumer. The producers each have their private blocking collections for enqueuing the elements
///   that they produce. The consumer of the producer queues is the multiplexer, which is responsible 
///   combining the inputs from all of the producers according to user-provided "lock order." The multiplexer 
///   provides an enumeration that a consumer can use to observe the multiplexed values in the chosen order. 
/// 
///   The multiplexer does not perform sorting. Instead, it relies on the fact the the producer queues are
///   locally ordered and looks for the next value by simultaneously monitoring the heads of 
///   all of the producer queues.
/// 
///   The order of elements in the producer queues is given by a user-provided lockOrderFn delegate. This is called
///   lock order and is represented by an integer. The initial lock id is specified in the multiplexer's constructor. 
///   Producer queues must be consistent. This means that they are locally ordered with respect to lock ids. When
///   multiplexed together into a single enumeration, the producer queues must produce a sequence of values whose 
///   lock ids are consecutive. (The lock ids in the individual producer queues must be in order but not necessarily 
///   consecutive.)
/// 
///   It is not required that all elements in the producer queues have a lock order. The position of such elements (denoted
///   by a lock id that is less than zero) is constrained by preceding and succeeding elements in the producer's queue
///   that do include a lock order. This results in a partial order. The unit tests for this class for an example of 
///   partial ordering constraints.
/// 
///   See Campbell et al, "Multiplexing of Partially Ordered Events," in TestCom 2005, Springer Verlag, June 2005,
