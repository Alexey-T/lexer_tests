GENERIC INTERFACE VarArray ( Subscript , Element , Ranges )

(* An instantiation of this interface provides a type T that, viewed
   abstractly, is an array having elements of type Element.T and bounds 
   covering the entire range of ordinal type Subscript.T, which can have 
   negative as well as positive values.

   Each value A in T has a distinguished initial element value InitElemValue(A), 
   provided by the client at the time A is created.  All elements of A contain 
   InitElemValue(A) until explicitly assigned otherwise by the client.  

   Each A in T also has a range of subscripts touched(A), called its _touched_ 
   range.  This module guarantees all elements outside of touched(A) are equal 
   to InitElemValue(A).  Usually, it does so by expanding touched(A) as 
   necessary.  The client can reduce touched(A), which implicitly assigns 
   InitElemValue to elements outside the reduced touched(A).    
    
   Concretely, the array is dynamically allocated and expanded/copied as
   needed to have elements that cover touched(A), plus often a controlled 
   amount of extra allocation to prevent overly frequent reallocation 
   and copying.  At any one time, there is only one allocated array in the 
   implementation.  A client has some control over allocation parameters.   

   All operations that accept a T as parameter require it to be a non-NIL
   value that was obtained as a result from a previous operation herein.
   
   All operations that mutate a T do so in place, i.e., if there are any
   pointer copies of the T value, they all see the mutation.
  
*) 

(* Instantiating interface Subscript must contain:
     TYPE T          An ordinal type, satisfying:
                       FIRST (INTEGER) <= ORD (FIRST (T)) 
                       AND ORD (LAST (T)) <= LAST (INTEGER)
                       AND NUMBER (T) >= 2 (So empty range is representable.)
                     The provided abstract array type T will be subscripted by 
                     this type.    

     CONST Brand     A TEXT, used to construct the brand for T.

   NOTE: There is little benefit to instantiating with a subrange for the 
         subscripts, since the arrays are dynamically allocated in response
         to actual use. 
*) 

(* Implementation restriction: 
     At any time, the number of allocated array elements cannot exceed
     LAST(CARDINAL).  This restriction is a consequence of Modula-3's 
     limitation of open arrays to this many elements.  The implementation 
     will not try to exceed this without explicit assignments being made 
     by the client.  Do you have this much RAM anyway? 
*) 

(* Instantiating interface Element must contain:
     TYPE T          A type other than an open array type.  
                     Elements of the provided array type T will have this 
                     type. 

     CONST Brand     A TEXT, used to construct the brand for T.
*) 

(* Instantiating interface Ranges must provide a few things that can be 
   conveniently provided by making it an instantiation of companion 
   generic Ranges, with its Base formal equal to Subscript here. 
*) 

(* ALLOCATION: Whenever the client performs any operation that does or
   could possibly assign to an element, the module, if needed, first expands 
   the allocated space to contain at least that element, in addition to any
   elements already allocated, which retain their values if touched.  
   Because a change to allocation entails O(N) copying of the prexisting 
   touched elements, whenever it must expand at all, it does so more 
   liberally than absolutely necessary, in order to reduce the frequency
   with which this happens.

   It multiplies the total allocated space by ExpansionFactor(A) (thus
   allocated size grows exponentially), but not more than an absolute
   maximum factor (thus eventually, allocated size reverts to growing
   linearly in large steps).  It also limits expansion to not exceed
   the limits of Subscript.T, nor the limits of CARDINAL subscripts to
   Modula-3 open arrays.  And of course, it expands not less that what
   is required to contain the about-to-be touched elements.  Subject
   to the above constraints, expansion is all upward, except when only 
   downward expansion is needed, in which case it is all downward.  

   A client can set ExpansionFactor(A) to 1.0 or less, with the result
   that the module will never allocate more than exactly needed to
   contain about-to-be-touched elements.  

   This module raises AllocationFailure whenever an operation cannot be
   correctly completed because of any space allocation problem, including 
   operations requiring the allocation of excessive-sized arrays, as well
   as actual NEW failures.  

*)

(* THREAD SAFETY: No synchronization is done internally.  Clients must ensure 
   that all operations within and changes to DefaultInitialSize and 
   ExpansionFactor(A) are mutually excluded.
