$f = fopen( "FILE.TXT", "wb" ) //open FILE.TXT for writing

//Now we can write some bytes or ASCII chars:

$char = 'A'
fputc( $char, $f )

$char = 0x20 //ASCII code 0x20 = SPACE
fputc( $char, $f )

$char = 'B'
fputc( $char, $f )

$char = 0xA //ASCII code 0x0A = NEWLINE
fputc( $char, $f )

//We can also write entire lines:

fprintf( $f, "Hello\n" )
fprintf( $f, "Pixi\n" )

fclose( $f )
