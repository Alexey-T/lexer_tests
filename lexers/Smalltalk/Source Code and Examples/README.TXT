The files on this diskette contain code and examples mentioned in the text
of the accompanying book.

Neither the author nor the publisher warranties the code or examples in any way.
There is no warranty that they are correct, or that they will fulfill their 
stated purpose. In particular, you include any additions or changes to system
classes at your own risk.

On the diskette are three different types of code.

First, the files in the 'examples' directory contain code that can be 
highlighted and evaluated. The files contain code matching the examples 
in the text. These files should not be filed in.

Second, the files in the 'classes' directory contain classes that can be 
filed in. These classes illustrate points that are made in the text. 
Normally there is an examples protocol on the class side that contains 
methods to execute.

Third, the files in the 'sysadds' and 'sysmods' directory contain additions 
and modifications to system classes. Note that there is always a risk in making 
changes to system classes, so incorporate these changes at your own risk.

The source code and examples are licensed to only one person per copy of this 
book. That person is free to use the code and examples in their own development 
environment or applications as they see fit. However, the licensed  person may 
not distribute the code or examples to other people.
