TODO

* Improve documentation, both of the code and Textile syntax.
** Not all functions have docstrings or adequate docstrings.
** Because the Textile syntax implemented by PyTextile has deviated from the syntax implemented by other implementations of Textile, PyTextile-specific documentation needs to be produced for end-users.
* Update to comply with Textile 2.5
