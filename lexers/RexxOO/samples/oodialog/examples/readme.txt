  1.  ooDialog Example Programs
  -------------------------------

  This directory contains example ooDialog programs.  They are intended to be
  relatively short and simple programs that demonstrate how to use some feature
  of ooDialog.

    - publicRoutines_demo.rex

    ooDialog contains a number of standard dialog and public routines.  The
    standard dialogs and public routines are designed to be easy to use.  They
    allow a programmer to added simple graphical elements to a program without
    any detailed knowledge of the ooDialog framework.  The publicRoutines_demo
    program demonstrates how to use these public routines.

    - fileNameDialog_demo.rex

    The FileNameDialog public routine allows a programmer to present the user
    with the standard Windows Open or Save file dialog.  The fileNameDialog_demo
    program demonstrates how to use this routine.

    - imageButton.rex

    This example program demonstrates some of the new features introduced in
    ooRexx 4.0.0, including the .Image, .Imagelist classes, and the
    setImageList() method of the button class.

    - columnClickListView.rex

    An example program that shows how to determine which row and which column
    in a list view control the user has clicked on.
