		
		DEMO Programs for the WIN32 Platform
		------------------------------------
 
 These are very primitive examples of how to call C routines in .DLL's and
 how to create simple windows. Bigger and better Windows demo programs are
 on the Archive page in the WIN32 section, and on the Recent User Contributions
 page. Most use the Win32Lib package, also on the Euphoria Web site.
 
 Run each program using exw.exe.
 
 window.exw  - A simple example of making a Window

 email.exw   - A demo of the MAPI (Messaging API) subsystem of the WIN32 API
               You may have to set up Outlook Express as your 
               "default Simple MAPI client" on the Tools/Options menu.
               Warning: this may send an e-mail message to the U.S. president.
               
 winwire.exw - A wire frame spinning E, inside a window (or full-screen if
               you edit a line in the file)
 
 taskwire.exw - A multitasking demo with several wire frame shapes spinning
                in parallel.
 
 dsearch.exw - A tool for finding out which .DLL contains the C function
               that you want to call

 To make GUI programs in Euphoria, download the Win32Lib package plus
 Judith Evans' Visual development environment for Win32Lib. You might also
 consider Andrea Cini's GUI library and IDE, or Mike's ARWEN library.
