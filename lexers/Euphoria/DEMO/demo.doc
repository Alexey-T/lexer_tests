		DEMO Programs Written in Euphoria
		---------------------------------

 This directory (and its subdirectories) contain a number of example programs
 written in Euphoria. You are encouraged to modify and redistribute any of 
 these programs. See License.txt for the details.
 
 Programs in the DOS32 subdirectory will only run using ex.exe. Programs
 in the WIN32 subdirectory will only run using exw.exe. Programs in the 
 Linux subdirectory will only using exu. All other demo programs
 can be run with any interpreter. You will have either DOS32 and WIN32
 subdirectories, or a Linux subdirectory depending on which distribution
 of Euphoria you have downloaded.
 
 Be sure that you have restarted your computer after installing Euphoria.
 AUTOEXEC.BAT (WinME/98/95) will add EUPHORIA\BIN to your PATH and 
 make ex.exe and exw.exe usable from any directory, including this DEMO 
 directory.
 
 To run a program type 'ex', 'exw' or 'exu' followed by the file name. e.g.
     
      ex buzz
      
      exw buzz.ex
      
      exu buzz.ex
      
 If the file type is .ex, you can try to run it with exw or exu, but you must
 explicitly type the ".ex" part.
 
 If you have associated .ex files with ex.exe, and .exw files with exw.exe 
 you can simply double-click to run any file. However, many programs expect 
 to be run from the command line and they will terminate immediately after 
 displaying something.

 You can view and modify these programs using any editor, but we recommend 
 using the Euphoria editor, ed, so you can get color syntax highlighting. 

 See also the tutorial directory for some very simple programs.
 
 NAME	  DESCRIPTION
 ----      -----------

 allsorts.ex - comparison of different sorting algorithms

 animal.ex - guess the animal game. It learns as you play.
	   
 buzz.ex   - "buzzword" generator - Try adding your own phrases.

 callmach.ex - examples of calling machine code from Euphoria
 
 csort.ex    - an example of calling custom_sort() with a routine id
 
 hash.ex   - counts the frequency of words in standard input by building a
             hash table (compare with tree.ex below). 
             Example:
                
                   ex hash < demo.doc
             
             Then view the hash.out file.
             
 mydata.ex - a simple database program that 
             uses EDS - the Euphoria Database System

 news.exu  - A multitasking demo that retrieves information from
             several Web sites in parallel. wget is required. 
             It is probably already available on your Linux or FreeBSD
             system. See the top of news.exu for details.
 
 queens.ex - solves the N queens problem - how to place N queens on an NxN
	     chess board so they do not attack each other

 sanity.ex - this program tests hundreds of features of Euphoria, in a quick,
	     self-test. If this program reports "PASSED" then Euphoria is
	     working on your machine. If not, there may be something wrong.
             You can run "ex sanity" or "exw sanity.ex"
             
 tree.ex   - counts the frequency of words in standard input by building a
             binary tree (compare with hash.ex above). 
             Example:
             
                 ex tree < demo.doc
 
 bench directory   - contains a benchmark that compares the speed of Euphoria
		     against other languages.

 langwar directory - contains a real-time star wars type game
                   - runs with ex
                   
 win32 directory   - programs that require exw.exe (Windows/DOS version only)
 
 dos32 directory   - programs that require ex.exe (Windows/DOS version only)

 linux directory   - programs that require exu (Linux version only)
