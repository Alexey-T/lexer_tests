			--------------------------

 To make learning Euphoria easier, and more fun, we have created some
 very simple programs. Most of them run in trace mode. They show you 
 step-by-step how to do common operations like reading in numbers, 
 printing numbers, opening files etc. There are comments on most of the 
 statements so someone who is new to Euphoria, or new to programming, 
 can understand exactly how each program works. Most of the programs do not 
 do anything useful, but they cover topics that sometimes are confusing to 
 beginners.
 
 Hopefully these interactive tutorials will be more stimulating for you than 
 simply reading a lot of dull text. You can actually watch each program
 executing, from the inside out, and see the values of variables etc.
 
 Once you understand these programs, you might want to download David Gay's
 "Beginner's Guide to Euphoria", or other tutorials available on the Web.
