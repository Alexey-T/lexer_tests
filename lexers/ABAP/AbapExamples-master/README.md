ABAP Examples
=============

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This github repository is intended as a public reference for documentation concerning the ABAP language and it's usage on the SAP platform. The content is free to use as is. The examples presented are using ABAP at it's fundamental technical level to help better understand the processes of SAP.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other users are free to contribute code, provide fixes, and other things by forking the repository. Wiki articles can be contributed as well. I just ask that you keep it as technical as possible, think running an ABAP stack with no particular SAP module involved, just ABAP.
