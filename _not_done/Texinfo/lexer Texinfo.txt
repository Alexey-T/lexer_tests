I began to write lexer Texinfo. 
filetype *.txi *.texi *.texinfo.
I see in syntax file of VSCode and see many many token kinds.

- simple @cmd w/o braces, for some set of keywords
- @cmd{...} with many variants and parsing of contents in braces
- some @cmd{...} have separate styles, e.g. @b @strong

VSCode file is very big.
so I stopped.
if any needs this lexer, write here. write what you need to highlight.
